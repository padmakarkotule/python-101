# YAML Anchors and aliases.
# let you identify an item with an anchor in a YAML document, and then
# refer to that item with an alias later in the same document. Anchors are
# identified by an & character, and aliases by an * character.
# Example,
defaults: &defaults
  adapter: postgres
  host: localhost

development:
  datanase: myapp_development
  <<: *defaults

test:
   database: myapp_test
   <<: *defaults

# choices: &C
#   a: one
#   b: two
#   c: three
