# yamllint - package can be used to check YAML file syntax error.
# E.g. yamllint repeat_code_example.yaml

# Yaml version. Versions are -
# - PyYAML      # YAML 1.1, pure python and libyaml binding

# Yaml example to avoid write repeated code.
# Use Anchor (&) and  alias (*)
# YAML Anchors and aliases.
# let you identify an item with an anchor in a YAML document, and then
# refer to that item with an alias later in the same document. Anchors are
# identified by an & character, and aliases by an * character.
# Example,
defaults: &defaults
  adapter: postgres
  host: localhost

development:
  datanase: myapp_development
  <<: *defaults

test:
   database: myapp_test
   <<: *defaults

# above code is not a document, these are two YAML documents in one file.
# The anchor definition &C doesn't carry from one YAML document to another,
# it can only be used up until the document separator ---

# Using Python convert the YAML to JSON format and check the output.
# Output will come in list object. Output will show JSON e.g.

# YANL Document end with ...
