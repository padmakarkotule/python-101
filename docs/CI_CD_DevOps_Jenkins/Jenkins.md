        We often need someone to hold our hand and help us take the first few steps before we learn to walk and run.  
        This is the vision behind Automation Step by Step
        
        1. Start from scratch
        2. Break down the topic
        3. Simplify things
        4. Go step by step
        
        Teaching is my passion and I design every course so you can start from scratch, knowing nothing about a topic and become an expert after the course and can work on enterprise projects.
        
        I was an Automation Test Architect for 10 years.
        I experienced that often many topics were made complex than they really are.
